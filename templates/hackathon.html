          <p align="justify">In February I had the chance to attend the future city hackathon in Szeged,
            which purpose was to provide solutions for an existing project the city is working on, called SASMOB.
            They are currently building a data-driven and responsive IT-system to make Szeged an environmentally
            friendly city.</p>
          <p align="justify">After the opening ceremony we had three exciting workshops related to the Sasmob
            project.<br>
          </p>

            <br>-Building and operating smart sensors<br>
            -Data acquisition using image recognition and wifi measurement<br>
            -Visualization of the collected data in mobile applications using the ionic framework</p>
          <p align="justify"> The challenge for the day was to provide new ideas for the project and ensure it will
            reach
            the expected results that is to encourage citizens towards more sustainable travel forms, higher the
            utilisation of
            public
            transport and this way lower the overall environmental impact of Szeged.</p>

          <div class="col-xs-6"></div>
          <img src="./static/assets/images/hackathon.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive reveal-content"
            data-action="zoom">
          <p align="justify">We received the collected datasets, which we quickly analysed with Power
            BI. From the data we easily saw that on a usual day more than 80% of the traffic is
            done by car on the main bridge.
            <br>After some additional research about the SASMOB project our team not found any indication that the
            applications
            under development provide a social interface for communication between the users.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            We did some brainstorming regarding the means we can use to shift the current commuting trends towards the
            more sustainable ones.
            Since we are not professional programmers as the other teams, we decided not to reinvent the wheel and
            create a social platform that besides provide real time traffic details to the
            citizens will also add more value for everyone involved. </p>
          <p align="justify">We've made the design sketch of the
            interface and started to think about how to higher the engagement of citizens & different companies.
            In order for to engage the smaller companies suggested to develop a function for smaller local companies
            to make special discount campaigns on the go based on the air pollution. For example local coffee shops
            can give discounts to people who
            choose to use a bicycle on these days. <br>Companies can also encourage
            their
            employees
            to find each other and share their car, promote their events in the app. To improve their brand these
            companies can also
            participate against each other who has the lowest mobility footprint, which the city can award with
            installing branded sensors providing continuing support for the project.<br>
            Lastly for the public transportation we suggested that it would also be a good idea to make campaigns and
            offer a discount
            on
            the tickets if the forecast shows that the air pollution will be higher or there is an increased chance
            for traffic jams.

            data-action="zoom"><br>
          <p align="justify"> At the end of the day we pitched our project in 3 minutes which was quite an experience.
            I can say the whole
            day was totally worth it and strenghten my determination that programming is something that I absolutely
            want to explore.<br>
            <br> Shout-out to Imi and Peti for the awesome team!

            <br>Cheers,<br>
